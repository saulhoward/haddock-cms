# Introduction #

Using the trunk of the development tree from the subversion repository for production systems is not recommended.

Instead, you should use a release from the tags directory.

# Details #

From time to time, we decided that a new version of Haddock CMS or one of its plug-ins should be released.

The release is copied to the tags directory and given a name such as

```
/core/tags/2008-02-21/
```
