Haddock CMS is an open source framework written in PHP for creating dynamic, database driven web applications.

It has been written and designed by Robert Impey and Saul Howard.

The hope is that the framework should not get in the way of the developer at any time and that its functions should be a welcome relief to the developer rather than something more to learn.

Another aim of the software is that it should be possible to drop code into an existing site without disrupting the existing site.

There are modules that allow for building HTML pages and working with a database in an object oriented fashion. The programmer is not forced to use them.

Haddock CMS is very much "evolved" code that has gone from hacked scripts to design patterns inspired object orientation and back again more times than we can remember. The end result is surprisingly usable and nicely structured.

Haddock CMS is in no way connected with Haddock, the Haskell documentation tool.
