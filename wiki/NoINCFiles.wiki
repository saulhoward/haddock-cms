#summary No .INC Files

= Introduction =

.INC files seem like a good idea but are a maintenance nightmare. They are avoided completely in Rockling code.

= How are they avoided? =

Everything in Rockling is a class. 

An HTML page is a class that extends [Public_HTMLPage].

If you want to create a new page, you extend that class and override some of the methods, e.g. {{{render_body_div_content}}}. Or simply implement the abstract function {{{content}}}.

The same is true of command-line scripts.

= But I like .INC files =

Maybe you think that I am imposing my ideas of good design on the framework. Perhaps this goes against the DesignPrinciples of Rockling. 

Every other framework out there seems to use templates in someway or another. If you want to use them, you should probably use one of them instead of Rockling.

Rockling is my attempt to get away from such code. There would be no reason to write Rockling if it was going to copy what's already out there.

Of course, you could implement a plug-in for Rockling that used .INC and templates files. But you'd need to put a gun to my head before I would look at it.
