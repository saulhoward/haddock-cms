#summary Compiling the Document Root's .htaccess file

= Introduction =

Various commands are given to Apache from the .htaccess file in the document root of a vhost.

This file is compiled from several fragments that are found in the core modules, the plug-ins and the project specific code.

These fragments are put together into a single file that is saved in the document root of the vhost.

This file should not be edited. Instead, you should edit the fragments of files and re run the compile script.
