#summary How Access Control Lists will work in Haddock CMS.

= Introduction =

A very common required feature of web pages is the an ACL.

This should be one of the first features to be implemented.

= Required Features =

 * Users can be stored in a RDBMS or an XML file.
 * Users can be members of groups.
 * Groups can be stored in an RDBMS or an XML file.
 * Group membership can be stored in a RDBMS or an XML file.
 * Page access can be restricted to groups or users. The permitted group should be the union  (or the complement of the union) of the specific groups and users.
 * It should be possible to control access to an individual page, a group of pages or even an item on a page.

= Unnecessary Complexity =

Do it all with the RDBMS first before implementing the XML file bits.
