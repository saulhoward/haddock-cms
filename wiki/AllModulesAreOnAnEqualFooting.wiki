#summary All modules are on an Equal Footing

= Introduction =

There's no concept of a "core" module in Rockling, they are all of equal value and can be deprecated and replaced at will.

= Common Modules =

Of course, that doesn't mean that all modules are equally useful or widely used.

It's hard to imagine a project that didn't use one or all of the following modules:

 * [HTTPResponseModule]
 * [CLIScriptsModule]
 * [DatabaseConnectionsModule]
 * [HTMLPagesModule]
 * [DefineConstantsModule]
 * [UnitTestsModule]

It's a good idea to check for the presence of modules in your unit tests.
