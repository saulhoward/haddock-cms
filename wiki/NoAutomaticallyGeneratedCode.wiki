#summary Haddock CMS Projects should have no code generators

= Introduction =

A lot of frameworks out there at the moment generate code automatically using command line scripts. I've ever written a few such scripts myself. Haddock CMS is phobic of such scripts.

= Writing Code should be painful =

Everyone knows that cut and paste programming is wrong. Why does it become OK if it's done on steroids via command line scripts?

You have an idea for a page. You should express just that idea. Any thing that can be generated by a command line script or any other program can (by definition) be refactored up the inheritance hierarchy.

I want my programs to be written with as few characters as possible. Every single character that goes into a program has a cost. It's another character to maintain.

If writing a program with a framework takes a lot of typing (or cutting and pasting or scaffolding) then it is broken and needs to be refactored. The hassle of having to write code out by hand is a good way to focus the mind on what needs fixing.

= Automatically Generated Code Appears Correct =

A danger of using automatically generated code is that it tricks you into thinking that it is somehow the correct way of doing things. "If the framework designers generate code like this, then that style is the style I should aim for." This a fallacy.

= Do the simplest thing that could possibly work =

This is one of the design principles of Haddock CMS.

If you generate a whole load code, it's more than likely that you are going to generate some code that you don't use. This then has to be removed. Or the script has to be altered. This script is now getting in the way of solving the problem.

= Exceptions =

Of course, one can argue that a compiler is a code generator. 
It generates code that is used by the operating system or virtual machine. 
It's not a bad idea to generate code that the programmer doesn't have to alter that speeds things up.
The CLI wrapper scripts for example will use this approach.
However, they should not be edited and can be deleted and regenerated at any time.
